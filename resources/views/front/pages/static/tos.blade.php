            <h6 class="mt-4">a.</h6>
            <p>Keep in mind, in consideration to laws of Bangladesh on shippable items,
fragility and other constraints rayat.com.bd does not carry every item that
you would find at our shops. The prices displayed on the website are
quoted in Bangladeshi Taka (Tk.) at our local webstore and converted into
other currencies for each respective country webstore where we offer
delivery. Rayat products displayed on the website may also be available in
select Rayat stores in Bangladesh while supplies last. In some cases,
merchandise shown online may not be available in stores. Stores may
also have different prices or promotional events at different times. Sale
prices on the website are Internet-only specials, and do not reflect the
pricing of Bangladesh stores. The pricing in international shops differ from
our local pricing to reflect the costs of doing business in those respective
regions.</p>


            <h6 class="mt-4">b. Handcrafted</h6>
            <p>Rayat products are handcrafted therefore we cannot guarantee that the
product you see online and the purchased product will be exactly the
same though every effort is made for it to be a very close match.</p>


            <h6 class="mt-4">c. Product Availability</h6>
            <p>Please understand that items featured on this website are handcrafted
and therefore in limited quantities and, because of their limited availability
and nature of production, stock may not be replenished. That means once
an item is sold out, it may not be available in the future and therefore may
not appear on the website again. When an item featured on rayat.com.bd
is no longer in stock, we make every attempt to remove that item from the
website in a timely manner. However, there are instances due to product
handling that a product will not meet our quality standards for shipment
and therefore may ultimately be unavailable for delivery. Should you have
any questions concerning the availability of a particular item, please
contact us at 9am – 6pm Bangladesh standard time.</p>



            <h6 class="mt-4">d. Colours</h6>
            <p>We have made every effort to represent each product colour as accurately
as possible on the website. However, due to monitor discrepancies of
personal computer/laptop/tablet/hand-held devices, we cannot guarantee
that your display of colour will be accurate.</p>



            <h6 class="mt-4">e. Pricing</h6>
            <p>In the event a Rayat product is listed at an incorrect price due to a system
error, typographical error or error in pricing information, Rayat shall have
the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for product listed at the
incorrect price.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">All our product prices and services are subject to tax as applicable by laws
of Bangladesh.</p>


            <h6 class="mt-4">f. Payment and Credit Note</h6>
            <p>Rayat shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders whether or not
the order has been confirmed within 14 working days from the date of your
order placement. If your credit/debit card or mobile banking wallet has
already been charged for the purchase and your order is canceled, Rayat
shall issue a credit note or refund the charged amount.</p>

            <h6 class="mt-4">g. Shipping and Processing Fees</h6>
            <p>Our shipping and processing charges are intended to compensate
designated shipping companies in addition to covering the cost of
processing your order, handling and packaging the purchased products
and delivering them to you. The risk of loss or damage of packaged items
are passed onto our shipping partners, and you will be compensated for
the full value of the items should they not reach you at all or in its original
state.</p>
